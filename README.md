# scorecardbuilder

R/Shiny interface to build a credit risk scorecard.

**Please note: This project is under heavy development. While the master branch will always contain a fully functional application, the interface is subject to revision on a periodic basis. It is expected to be relatively stable after 30th June, 2019.**

This application is a Web-based interface to develop credit risk scorecards. It is primary intended to be an interface for binning, modelling and validation. Exploratory data analysis, sampling and segmentation are out of scope for this application.

Please review the [Issues](https://github.com/radmuzom/scorecardbuilder/issues) page for known bugs and planned enhancements.
