* The model can be trained once the binning is complete.

* All variables which have been binned succesfully will appear in the 'Choose
Variables' list. Remove them from the list to exclude them from modelling.

* The scaling parameters can be adjusted to obtain a desired log-odds at a
particular score.

* The scorecard is created on the training data and applied on the test data.
Regression coefficients are estimated separately on the test data to ensure
that they remain significant in the test data.

* Overall diagnostics to measure the discrimination, accuracy and
stability of the scorecard are displayed in the Validation tab.
